# Image Entropy Calculator

This script calculates the entropy of an image, which is a measure of the randomness or complexity in the image. 

## Description

The script reads an image in grayscale, computes the probability distribution of the intensity values, and then calculates the entropy based on this distribution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library

## Usage

To use this script, you need to have an image file named 'image.jpg' in the same directory as the script. You can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python entropy_nanocomposite.py
